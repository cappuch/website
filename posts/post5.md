# Apple Airports from 2009

Apple Airports are a lineup of high-end networking devices that Apple produced for years. Recently, I stumbled upon one during a school trip to [Limerick](https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&gl=ie&um=1&fb=1&ftid=0x485b5bf9a3aa1aed:0xa039bb374d9bd999). My usual habit on these trips is to hunt for Xbox 360 Kinects (without power supplies) because they’re often just 1 euro each. But, I bought out the only single Kinect I found, and, right above where the employee was taking the Kinect from the drawer under the shelf, I saw an Airport. I take a peek at the price tag, and it’s just 12 euros. I couldn’t believe it! Bought it on the spot.

## Setting It Up

When I plugged it in, it powered on without issue. However, it still had the previous owner’s configuration. Thankfully, resetting it was straightforward. Once I got it up and running, I noticed significant lag. After some troubleshooting, I realized the issue: the device was in `router` mode. Switching it to `bridge` mode resolved the problem.

To make the most of the Airport Extreme, I connected it to my old switch and repurposed an empty bookshelf as a makeshift network rack.

## Putting It to Use

Now, the setup powers my PS4 and a small server I use for various projects. The Airport Extreme really does shine with this kind of setup. It’s a testament to how older tech can still be incredibly useful!

## Final Thoughts

For just 12 euros, the 3rd Gen Airport Extreme has proven to be a fantastic addition to my network. It’s a testament to how older tech can still be incredibly useful when repurposed creatively. Whether it’s running consoles or servers, this little device has found a second life in my home setup.
