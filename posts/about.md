# About Me
My name is Mikus! I'm 16 years old. I'm a student, and a 'developer' if you could call me one. I like to do miscellaneous machine learning research, mostly tailoring towards audio and vision.

## Accidental Achievements
- Somehow wound up at Microsoft Irish HQ for a day presenting a self-driving car project (I'm not sure how that happened either)
- Also wound up at BD (Becton Dickinson), presenting an OCR project
