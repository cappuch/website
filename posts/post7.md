# 3060s and ML

RTX 3060s come in two flavors: the 8GB and the 12GB models. The most common model I've noticed is the 12GB variant, which I actually have (albiet, a 'Lite Hash Rate' version). As far as I know, Lite Hash Rate (LHR) cards are designed to be less efficient at mining Ethereum, by reducing the hash rate somehow. I'm not entirely sure how this works, but I've heard that it's possible to bypass the LHR limitation by using a modified driver. I haven't tried this myself, so I can't confirm if it works.

The LHR limitation doesn't affect my use case, as I'm not mining Ethereum. I'm using the 3060 for gaming and machine learning, and it's been performing well in both areas. I've trained a few models on it, and the performance has been quite good. I've also used it for gaming, and it's been able to handle most games at 1080p with high settings.

The 3060 is a great card for machine learning, especially if you're on a budget. It's not as powerful as the 3080 or 3090, but it's still quite capable. If you're looking for a card that can handle most machine learning workloads without breaking the bank, the 3060 is a solid choice.

# Conclusion
I'm currently too lazy to benchmark the 3060, but I'll update this post with some performance metrics once I get around to it. In the meantime, I hope this post has been helpful. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them below. Thanks for reading!
